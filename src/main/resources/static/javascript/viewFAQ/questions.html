                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Barkbook is a place where you can create a personal profile page for your dog; basically a creative Facebook page for your best friend, without seeming like an obsessive dog owner...because we all are here!</p>
                        <p>The profiles, Paw Places, allow you to upload a picture of your dog and display some basic information. You can edit the color and font of some of the text and even give your dog a clever tagline.</p>
                        <p>Barkbook is the place where your dog gets to have his name in lights.</p></div>

                        <p>The short answer...no.</p>
                        <p>The better answer...yes!</p>
                        <p>You can visit the Explore page and check out all of our cute dogs and their customized Paw Places without signing-in. But if you would like to create your own Paw Place, you have to sign-in so I can keep track of all your info!</p>

                        <p>Simply click on the Google or Facebook buttons on the Paws In page, a pop-up window will appear and you'll be remembered for next time!</p>
                        <p>If your email address if the same for your Google and Facebook accounts though, you have to make sure when you are logging back into Barkbook that you click the service provider you originally used.</p>

                        <p>The links can be to a Facebook picture, Instagram picture, or any link. Make sure the link is directly to the image though, and not the page that contains the image.</p>
                        <p>If you have a picture of your dog, and want to transform it into a link, <a href="https://imgur.com/" class="MO-faq-fa">imgur</a> is a simple and easy place to use.</p>
