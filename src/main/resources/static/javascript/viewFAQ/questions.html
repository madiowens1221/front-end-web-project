                    <div class="answer"><p>Pack is the new website to capture and share the everyday moments in your dog’s life. Because with a dog by your side, you are never alone.</p>
                        <p>Pack knows what you know: that dogs are family. Our dogs wake us up with a wag in the morning and welcome us home at the end of a long day. In the middle of our hectic schedules and human drama, dogs remind us that life can be simple and love can be easy. </p>
                        <p>It’s an opportunity to capture the everyday dog moments in your life and organize them into a gorgeous online lookbook just for your dog. Don’t keep your dog photos hidden on your phone, and don’t worry about your Facebook friends calling you dog obsessed... Pack is the place where your dog gets to have his name in lights.</p></div>
